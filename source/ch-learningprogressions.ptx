    <title>Data Science Learning Progressions: A Framework for Success</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            The Data Science Learning Progressions provide a comprehensive framework for what students should know and be able to do at each grade level. Rather than a rigid sequence, these progressions offer flexibility while ensuring students develop essential skills systematically from kindergarten through 12th grade.
        </p>
    </introduction>

        <title>Framework Overview</title>
        
        <p>
            The learning progressions are organized into five interconnected strands that work together to develop complete data science literacy:
        </p>

        <p>
            <alert>Strand A: Data Dispositions and Responsibility</alert> | <alert>Strand B: Creation and Curation</alert> | <alert>Strand C: Analysis and Modeling Techniques</alert> | <alert>Strand D: Interpreting Problems and Results</alert> | <alert>Strand E: Visualization and Communication</alert>
        </p>

        <p>
            Each strand progresses from foundational concepts in early elementary through advanced applications in high school, with opportunities for acceleration and depth based on student readiness and interest.
        </p>

    <section xml:id="section-integration">
        <title>How the Strands Work Together</title>
        
        <p>
            The power of this framework lies in how the strands integrate and reinforce each other. A typical data science investigation might involve:
        </p>

        <p>
            <alert>Step 1 - Strand A</alert>: Considering ethical implications and developing investigative questions
        </p>
        <p>
            <alert>Step 2 - Strand B</alert>: Collecting and preparing appropriate data
        </p>
        <p>
            <alert>Step 3 - Strand C</alert>: Analyzing data using appropriate tools and techniques
        </p>
        <p>
            <alert>Step 4 - Strand D</alert>: Interpreting results and considering their validity and limitations
        </p>
        <p>
            <alert>Step 5 - Strand E</alert>: Communicating findings effectively to drive action
        </p>

        <p>
            This integrated approach ensures students don't just learn isolated skills, but develop the complete toolkit needed for ethical, effective data science practice.

    <section xml:id="section-implementation-flexibility">
        <title>Implementation Flexibility</title>
        
        <p>
            The learning progressions are designed to support multiple implementation approaches:
        </p>

        <p>
            <alert>Dedicated Courses</alert>: Full data science courses can systematically address all strands. <alert>Integrated Modules</alert>: Individual strands or concepts can enhance existing subject areas. <alert>Cross-Curricular Projects</alert>: Real-world investigations can naturally incorporate multiple strands. <alert>Differentiated Instruction</alert>: Students can work at appropriate levels within each strand.
        </p>

        <p>
            This flexibility ensures that every school can find an approach that fits their context while still providing students with essential data science skills.
